# MatchingPatchers
Algorithm to pairwise match patch cohort members in order to maximise meet ups between members who do not know each other or do not know each other well.

As this is an NP-Hard problem, a near optimal solution is returned by default when the number of members is >14.

Otherwise, an optimal solution solution is returned.

If there are an odd number of members to be matched. There will be a singular triplet.
