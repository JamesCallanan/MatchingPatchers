Hello {patcher1} and {patcher2},

You have been paired for Patch chats!

We recommend that you exchange phone numbers/socials and organise a video call or in-person meet up before October 2nd. 

Applications such as https://whenufree.io/ or https://calendly.com/ may be useful for finding times that suit you both.

Here are some potential conversation starters!
Where are you in your life? What are you up to?
What are you passionate about or interested in?
What projects have you been working on or what have you been learning about recently?
Any plans for the future?
What is your most important habit (or habit you are trying to make stick!)?
What do you do to have fun / relax?

The suggested default call length is 15 minutes. That said, we encourage you to extend the call or keep in contact if interests overlap and time allows!

Hope you have a good chat and thanks for signing up!

Best,
James & the team
